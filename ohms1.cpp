* This file contains code for Task 1 of Part of L8. This program
* allows for 'unlimited' resistors by using the vector class. The
* program outputs total power, series current, voltage source, and
* power and resistance for each resistor. Task 1 implements a
* basic simple 1-node DC CKT Simulator.
