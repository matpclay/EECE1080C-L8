This text file contains the test data for Part 1 of the lab. These were tested separately because the output with both 
looks a little funny due to when the deconstructor is called for the first instance.

Overloaded Constructor:

Circuit Parameters: 
	Resistance: 1 ohm
	Voltage: 10 volts
	Current: 10 Amps
	Power: 100 Watts
Circuit Destroyed

Standard Constructor:

Enter Voltage: 100
Enter Resistance: 50

Circuit Parameters: 
	Resistance: 50 ohm
	Voltage: 100 volts
	Current: 2 Amps
	Power: 200 Watts
Circuit Destroyed
